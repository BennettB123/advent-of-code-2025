# Advent of Code 2025

I'm starting this [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as an AI detox. After using AI tools heavily for several months, taking a break feels like a good idea. I want to keep my skills sharp and get back to some of the most fundamental things that I enjoy about software development, solving tough problems and writing code... by hand.

I'll be using the [go programming language](https://go.dev/) and I'm going to forbid myself from using AI completely. No GitHub Copilot, no Claude Code, no ChatGPT, and not even the "AI Overview" that Google spits out at the top of the search results. Back to RTFM.
